## Survey sheds light on the 'crisis' rocking research.

**More than 70% of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist's experiments**, and more than half have failed to reproduce their own experiments. Those are some of the telling figures that emerged from *Nature*'s survey of 1,576 researchers who took a brief online questionnaire on reproducibility in research.

The data reveal sometimes-contradictory attitudes towards reproducibility. Although 52% of those surveyed agree that there is a significant 'crisis' of reproducibility, less than 31% think that failure to reproduce published results means that the result is probably wrong, and most say that they still trust the published literature.

## The Survey

In the survey 1 [^1] respondents were asked to rate 11 different approaches to improving reproducibilty in science. Below is the list order by the most highly rated:

- Better understanding of statistics
- Better mentoring/supervision
- More robust design
- Better teaching
- More within-lab validation
- Incentives for better practice
- Incentives for formal reproduction
- More external-lab validation
- More time for mentoring
- Journals enforcing standards
- More time checking notebooks
